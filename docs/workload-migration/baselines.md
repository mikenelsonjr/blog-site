## Migrating Baselines from one UEM environment to another.

### Overview
The Baselines screen in the tool shows a high level view of the different baselines configured in the Source environment. It specifically highlights the Baseline *name*, *template used*, and its *migration status*.

The migration status check is for a Baseline of the exact same name in the destination environment.

### Migration
1. Select the Baseline to migrate.
1. Click the Migrate Button
1. Monitor the status in the migration status column.

Once the process is complete, the Migration Status column will update accordingly.
